## 📖 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization** on a large flight dataset.  
We answer key questions such as:

- Which airline has the highest number of flights?  
- Do flight prices change with departure/arrival times?  
- How do prices vary between Economy and Business classes?  
- How does booking **1–2 days before travel** impact price?  
- What is the behavior of ticket prices across different cities?

This project is ideal for:
- Data Analytics learners  
- Python & Pandas practice  
- Visualization and storytelling  
- Portfolio building
